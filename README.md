### Project Description  
WelcomeHome is a non-profit organization, similar to Ruth's Refuge, dedicated to supporting refugees and asylum seekers by providing housewares and furniture. The organization:  
- Accepts **donations** of used items and monetary contributions for new purchases.  
- Allows **clients** to select needed items through an online portal.  
- Organizes **volunteers** to collect, label, and deliver items to clients' homes.  

To enhance efficiency and improve service delivery, WelcomeHome requires a streamlined management system capable of handling:  
- **Donations**, **orders**, and **deliveries**  
- **Clients**, **donors**, and **volunteers**  

This project aims to design and implement such a management system to optimize the organization's operations.
